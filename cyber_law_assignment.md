# Building a Resilient Digital Future: Proposing Legal Reforms for Cyber Law in Bangladesh Based on Leading Global Examples

## 1. Introduction
In the era of rapid digital transformation, cyber law plays a crucial role in ensuring secure and responsible use of the internet and digital technologies. With increasing internet penetration in Bangladesh, the need for robust cyber legislation has become paramount. However, existing laws have been criticized for being outdated, vague, or even repressive. This assignment explores the current legal framework in Bangladesh, identifies its limitations, and proposes reforms inspired by leading global models to build a resilient digital future.

## 2. Current Cyber Law Landscape in Bangladesh
Bangladesh's cyber legal framework primarily includes the following laws:

- **Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act, 2006 (Amended in 2013)**: Initially introduced to address electronic crimes but criticized for ambiguous language and misuse.
- **Digital Security Act (DSA), 2018**: Replaced the controversial sections of the ICT Act, aiming to modernize cyber regulations.

### Key Issues in Current Framework:
- Ambiguity in legal definitions
- Allegations of human rights violations and misuse
- Limited protection for personal data and privacy
- Lack of dedicated cybercrime courts and trained judicial personnel

## 3. Challenges Facing Bangladesh’s Cyber Law
1. **Increasing Cybercrime**: Rapid digital adoption has led to a rise in cyber fraud, hacking, identity theft, and cyberbullying.
2. **Limited Digital Literacy Among Law Enforcers**: Many officers lack training in handling cyber incidents.
3. **Judicial Backlog and Jurisdictional Confusion**: Delayed justice due to overlaps in authority and lack of clarity.
4. **Freedom of Expression vs. Security**: Provisions in DSA are often criticized for curbing freedom of speech.
